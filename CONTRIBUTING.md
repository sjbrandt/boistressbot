# Contributing to BoistressBot
1. Ask me to add you as a contributor
2. Create your branch in the format `<your-username>/<branch-name>`
    - `<branch-name>` must use hyphens (`-`) instead of spaces (not underscores)
3. When done, pull request and I will review
4. When ready to merge, squash with a message in the style of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
